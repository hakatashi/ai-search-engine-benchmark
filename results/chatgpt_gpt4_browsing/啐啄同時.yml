result: The four-character idiom you're referring to is "啐啄同時" (Sottaku Douji). This
  phrase is used to describe a situation where the harmony between a teacher and a
  student is excellent, similar to the scenario where a bird hatches from its egg
  by pecking from the inside while the mother bird pecks from the outside at the same
  time. It appears there is an issue with my ability to quote from the source pages
  at this time, but the information can be confirmed on various online Japanese idiom
  dictionaries.
